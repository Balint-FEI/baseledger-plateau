This file is the stating point for everyone wanting to run a Baseledger (validator) node.

1) Applications for becoming a validator node operator have to be cleared by the Baseledger Council first (baseledger.foundation).
Please apply first, using the following form: https://forms.gle/Vcp1t4XFUxmct9yc9
Without an approved application you wont be able to join the network.

2) Once you application is approved, you can start setting up the node. The technical setup on how to do it is layed out in the file add_node_to_baseledger_mainnet.md in this folder.

3) During node setup you will be required to receive an initial stake token to join the mainnet. Please request the token opening a ticket on our support portal stating your newly created Baseledger address to send a token to. Be sure to select the product/section "Baseledger" when opening the ticket and use the same email address for creating the ticket that you used to apply for running a node.
